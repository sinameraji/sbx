# Benchmarks

hotcell measured with [computesdk/benchmarks](https://github.com/computesdk/benchmarks) — the same open-source harness behind the public [sandbox provider leaderboard](https://www.computesdk.com/benchmarks/sandboxes/).

Run on 2026-07-19/20 against hotcell v0.1.10 (`main@d897b0c`). Provider numbers quoted for context are from that project's published run of 2026-07-17.

The four latency benchmarks below were run through the ComputeSDK harness unmodified. The [real-workload benchmark](#sandbox-dax) is the same underlying script run through hotcell's own harness on bare metal — that section says so and links the raw output.

## Read this before quoting any number

**hotcell's numbers have no network in them; the leaderboard's do.** The public benchmark runs on a US CI runner and calls each provider's cloud API over the internet. hotcell is self-hosted, so the harness ran on the same machine as the daemon. That is the honest operating condition for a self-hosted sandbox — and it is *not* an apples-to-apples comparison with a hosted provider's number. Where this page compares, it says so explicitly.

Nothing here is an official leaderboard result. hotcell is not listed on that leaderboard (see [Getting officially listed](#getting-officially-listed)).

## The benchmarks

The suite measures **TTI (Time to Interactive)**: wall-clock from `create()` to the first successful `runCommand("node -v")`. Teardown is not timed. Scoring is `(0.60·median + 0.25·p95 + 0.15·p99)` scored against a 10-second ceiling, multiplied by success rate — 0–100, higher is better.

| Benchmark | What it does | What it exposes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Sequential TTI](#sequential-tti) | 100 sandboxes, one at a time | Cold-start latency with no contention |
| [Staggered TTI](#staggered-tti) | 100 sandboxes launched 200 ms apart | Degradation as load ramps |
| [Burst TTI](#burst-tti) | 100 sandboxes created simultaneously | Behaviour under a thundering herd |
| [Warm-pool adopt](#warm-pool-adopt) | Create against a pre-booted pool | The floor when a microVM is already running |
| [sandbox-dax](#sandbox-dax) | Clone + install + typecheck a real repo | Real dev-workload throughput, and the memory/CPU a real build actually demands |

Hardware: **Mac** = M-series, 8 cores / 16 GB, Docker Desktop with an 8 GB VM. **GCP** = 8 vCPU / 32 GB, nested virtualisation.

### Sequential TTI

100 iterations, one sandbox at a time. The leaderboard's headline metric.

| Driver | Host | Median | P95 | P99 | Success | Score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Container (Docker) | Mac | **210 ms** | 237 ms | 240 ms | 100/100 | 97.8 |
| Firecracker microVM (cold) | GCP | 2,559 ms | 2,568 ms | 2,573 ms | 100/100 | 74.4 |
| Apple VZ microVM (cold) | Mac | 2,618 ms | 2,712 ms | 2,724 ms | 100/100 | 73.4 |

The container driver's 210 ms is quick in absolute terms — the published leaderboard's mid-pack sits between 190 ms and 460 ms, with E2B at 373 ms and Modal at 458 ms, network included. If hotcell were hosted next to the benchmark's CI runners, a network allowance of roughly 20–80 ms would still leave it ahead of most of that pack. That allowance is an estimate, not a measurement: from the machine used for these runs, the round-trip to a cloud daemon was ~192 ms, which would erase the gap entirely. **Where you run it decides the number.**

Cold microVM boots are the opposite story: ~2.6 s is second-slowest against the published field, because every boot here is a real kernel boot with no pre-warming, while fast hosted providers serve from warm capacity. The fix is hotcell's own warm pool — see below.

Worth noting on its own: p95 lands 9 ms above the median on Firecracker and 94 ms on Apple VZ, across 100 cold boots. Boot time is highly predictable.

### Staggered TTI

100 sandboxes, one launched every 200 ms.

| Driver | Host | Concurrency | Median | P95 | Success | Score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Container | Mac | 100 | 300 ms | 347 ms | 100/100 | 96.8 |
| Apple VZ | Mac | 25 | 2,603 ms | 2,618 ms | 25/25 | 73.9 |
| Firecracker | GCP | 100 | 14,081 ms | 16,281 ms | 100/100 | 0 |

The container driver barely moves under a ramp (210 ms → 300 ms). Firecracker at 100 concurrent kernel boots on 8 vCPUs is CPU-bound — every sandbox came up, but the queue is the machine, not the driver. Apple VZ was capped at 25 because 100 microVMs exceed a 16 GB laptop; those rows are not comparable to a 100-wide run.

### Burst TTI

All sandboxes requested at once.

| Driver | Host | Concurrency | Median | P95 | Success | Score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Container | Mac | 25 | 1,796 ms | 2,412 ms | 25/25 | 79.5 |
| Container | Mac | 100 | 10,115 ms | 12,778 ms | 100/100 | 0 |
| Apple VZ | Mac | 25 | 3,176 ms | 3,382 ms | 25/25 | 67.4 |
| Firecracker | GCP | 100 | 32,027 ms | 32,626 ms | 97/100 | 0 |

**This is hotcell's weakest result, and it is structural.** A 100-wide burst measures how much capacity sits behind an API. Hosted providers spread it across a fleet; a self-hosted daemon has one machine, and 100 simultaneous kernel boots serialise on its CPUs. The leaderboard's fastest burst numbers (tens to hundreds of milliseconds) are fleet numbers. If you need a 100-wide burst to be fast on one box, size a warm pool to cover it.

The three Firecracker failures were typed `422 agent never came up` — vsock handshake timeouts during the boot storm, not hangs or crashes.

One earlier container burst-100 run, with the daemon's default 256 MiB per-sandbox reservation, completed only **30/100**: admission control refused 70 creates with a fast, typed `503 host memory budget exhausted` rather than over-subscribing the box. Re-running with a smaller reservation completed 100/100. That refusal is the designed behaviour — hotcell will not OOM the host to look good on a burst — but it is a real number and it belongs here.

### Warm-pool adopt

hotcell can keep pre-booted microVMs on standby (`HOTCELL_VZ_WARM_POOL`, `HOTCELL_FC_WARM_POOL`) and adopt one on create instead of booting a kernel.

**Measured floor: 24 ms median** (10 iterations: 33, 28, 21, 23, 27, 19, 24, 16, 24, 23 ms; min 16, max 33). Apple VZ, all ten confirmed adopted from the pool.

Caveats, because this number is attractive and easy to misuse:

- It is **not an official TTI measurement**. It used hotcell's Alpine base image and an `echo` probe with a custom timer, not the harness's `node:22-slim` + `node -v`. `node -v` alone adds process-spawn cost.
- n = 10, localhost.
- Known defects currently stop warm pools from serving real workload images, so this floor is **not reachable in normal use today**:
  1. Setting a daemon-wide default limit (`HOTCELL_DEFAULT_MEMORY_MB` and friends) makes every create ineligible for adoption — eligibility requires no explicit limits, and the daemon folds its defaults into every request — so the sandbox cold-boots while a full pool sits idle. Affects both microVM drivers, and it is what silently defeated adoption in the two warm runs in the table above.
  2. On Apple VZ the pool image is hardcoded to the built-in Alpine base image (`applevz.ts`, a `readonly` field), so a `node:22-slim` create can never adopt a spare. Firecracker does not share this defect — its pool image follows the daemon's configured image — though its pool was not successfully exercised in these runs.
- **Pool depth, not adopt latency, is the real constraint.** Spares refill *serially* at ~2.55 s each (~0.39 guests/sec), while cold creates fan out in parallel at ~3.4/sec on the same host. A pool therefore only wins for the first N requests against an idle daemon; past that it refills slower than cold-booting. Sizing a pool to absorb a 100-wide burst also means holding 100 guests' worth of RAM, which no laptop has.

Treat 24 ms as evidence that the adopt path itself is fast, not as a TTI hotcell can currently deliver, and not as something that scales to bursts. Making adoption fire at all, refilling pools in parallel, and making pooled guests visible to admission control are the open work.

### sandbox-dax

The suite's real-workload benchmark: inside one sandbox, download Bun, clone the OpenCode repo, `bun install`, `bun typecheck` — seven timed phases. The `sandbox-dax` mode runs [dax's OpenCode provider benchmark](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) (`script/provider-benchmark.sh` on the `provider-benchmark` branch).

**hotcell has run this workload extensively** — the same script, unmodified, on Firecracker microVMs. Full raw output for every run, including every failure, is in [`evidence/opencode-benchmark/`](../evidence/opencode-benchmark/). What follows is the summary; that directory is the source of truth.

One difference in provenance matters: those runs used hotcell's own harness (`bench-suite.sh` — cold microVM per run, sampled peak guest memory, outcomes classified `PASS`/`OOM`/`INSTALL_FLAKE`/`ADMISSION`), *not* ComputeSDK's `--mode sandbox-dax` wrapper. So there is no ComputeSDK-format score row for hotcell here. The underlying workload and its phase timings are the same; the reporting is deeper.

**Bare metal, Ryzen 9 5950X, 5 cold reps at 32 vCPU / 32 GiB** ([`32vcpu-5reps.txt`](../evidence/opencode-benchmark/raw/hetzner-5950x/32vcpu-5reps.txt)):

| Phase | Median |
| --- | --- |
| Clone | 4.34 s |
| Install | 13.44 s |
| Typecheck | 17.42 s |
| **Workload total** (clone + install + typecheck) | **35.385 s** |
| Full script total (all seven phases) | 58.45 s |

The same script on the bare host, no VM at all, totals 30.411 s ([`control-bare-host.txt`](../evidence/opencode-benchmark/raw/hetzner-5950x/control-bare-host.txt)) — so the microVM costs about 16 % on this workload, which is the honest price of the isolation.

Against the published 2026-07-17 run, where **only one of nineteen providers (Modal) completed all seven phases** — full-script total 62.594 s, install 20.361 s, typecheck 24.896 s, from a single iteration:

- At **32 vCPU** hotcell's full-script total is 58.45 s, about 7 % faster than Modal's — but on 32 dedicated bare-metal cores, which is almost certainly a larger machine than Modal's sandbox. Not a like-for-like win.
- At **8 vCPU** hotcell totals ~70 s, about 12 % *slower* than Modal.
- **Install came in under Modal's 20.4 s at every rung tested** (11.7–19.4 s), though only marginally so at 2 vCPU — it is bound more by disk than by cores.
- **Typecheck tracks cores**: 30.7 s at 8 vCPU, 20.2 s at 16, 17.4 s at 32 — so Modal's 24.9 s sits between hotcell's 8- and 16-vCPU rungs.

The more useful result is not a single row but the **demand curve** — what this workload actually requires, which no leaderboard reports:

- **Memory floor is a band, not a line.** Peak working set varies 11.0–14.2 GiB across byte-identical reps, so rungs near the edge flip: ≤ 8 GiB always OOMs, 12 GiB passed 1 of 3, 16 GiB passed 3 of 3 in one session but OOM'd in an earlier one, ≥ 24 GiB has never failed. Provision ≥ 24 GiB for this workload, not 16.
- **CPU knee at 8–16 vCPU.** Typecheck median at 32 GiB: 102.8 s (2 vCPU) → 53.9 s (4) → 30.7 s (8) → 20.2 s (16) → 17.4 s (32). Gains per doubling fall 1.91× → 1.76× → 1.52× → 1.16×. Past 16 cores you are buying very little.
- **Default-deny egress is free.** With the guest holding no NIC and all traffic crossing the vsock gateway, the same workload ran 3/3 at 46.211 s median at 8 vCPU — no measurable cost against the NAT rung at the same config. The workload needs exactly three allowlist entries (`nodejs.org`, `api.github.com`, `pkg.pr.new`), measured from denial logs.

Measuring this also surfaced and fixed three product bugs (a `writableRootfs` gap, a git 407-CONNECT failure, and a resume-path admission gap), and one open one: in the microVM guest `bun install` source-builds `tree-sitter-powershell` instead of using the shipped prebuilt, worked around by putting npm's bundled `node-gyp` on PATH at a cost of ~1.3 s. Root cause still open, documented in [`nodegyp-diagnostic.txt`](../evidence/opencode-benchmark/raw/hetzner-5950x/nodegyp-diagnostic.txt).

## Summary

- **Cold-start latency for one sandbox is good** — 210 ms on the container driver, competitive with the hosted mid-pack even after a hosting allowance, provided you host it comparably.
- **Boot times are consistent** — microVM p95 within 9–94 ms of median over 100 cold boots.
- **Cold microVM boots are slow** — ~2.6 s, second-slowest against the published field, until warm pools cover real images.
- **Single-host burst is the weak spot** — one machine is one machine.
- **Failures are clean** — typed 4xx/5xx from admission control, no hangs; 11 of 13 runs at 100 % success, worst case 30/100 under deliberate memory pressure.
- **Real build workloads run at roughly a 16 % virtualisation cost**, with default-deny egress adding nothing measurable — and the demand curve behind that number (memory floor, CPU knee) is published rather than reduced to one row.

## Reproducing this

The harness talks to any endpoint, so a local daemon works:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/computesdk/benchmarks && cd benchmarks && npm install
```

Add a provider that wraps the hotcell SDK (`src/sandbox/hotcell-provider.ts`):

```ts
import { HotcellClient } from '@hotcell/sdk';

export function hotcell(opts: { endpoint: string; apiKey?: string; image?: string; driver?: string }) {
  const client = new HotcellClient({ endpoint: opts.endpoint, apiKey: opts.apiKey });
  return {
    sandbox: {
      create: async () => {
        const sb = await client.getSandbox(undefined, { image: opts.image, driver: opts.driver });
        return {
          sandboxId: sb.id,
          runCommand: async (cmd: string) => {
            const r = await sb.exec(cmd);
            return { exitCode: r.exitCode, stdout: r.stdout, stderr: r.stderr };
          },
          destroy: () => sb.destroy(),
        };
      },
    },
  };
}
```

Register it in `src/sandbox/providers.ts`, then:

```bash
HOTCELL_IMAGE=node:22-slim hotcelld &          # the probe is `node -v` — the image needs Node
export HOTCELL_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:4750

npx tsx src/run.ts --provider hotcell --mode sequential --iterations 100
npx tsx src/run.ts --provider hotcell --mode staggered --concurrency 100 --stagger-delay 200
npx tsx src/run.ts --provider hotcell --mode burst      --concurrency 100
```

Pick concurrency your host can actually hold — the numbers above show what happens when you don't.

## Getting officially listed

hotcell does not appear on the public leaderboard. That requires a `@computesdk/<provider>` package merged into [computesdk/computesdk](https://github.com/computesdk/computesdk) (they publish it), a publicly reachable production endpoint, and credentials handed to the maintainers for the weekly run. Until then, everything here is self-reported and reproducible with the commands above.
