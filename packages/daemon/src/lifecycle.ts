 * A `paused` sandbox has had its compute freed but keeps its workspace, so the
 * next operation transparently resumes it. Pause comes in two strengths, picked
 * automatically per sandbox: on microVM drivers that support it, pause is a
 * **memory snapshot** (guest RAM + devices saved; background processes come back
 * alive on resume — nothing is lost by pausing); otherwise it's the cold
 * stop-with-volume (workspace survives, processes don't). A `stopped` sandbox is
 * user-intent and is never auto-resumed nor auto-paused.
 *
 * The paused/stopped → running edge is **admission-gated**: a resume re-commits
 * the sandbox's memory, so it must fit the host budget just like a create
 * (`Capacity.admitAndReserve`); an over-budget resume throws `CapacityError`,
 * which API/proxy callers surface as 503.
